! Example parameter file that swaps from a 8x8x8 mesh to a 4x4x4 mesh, changing the polynomial degree from
! NOld=3 to NNew=4. We do not specify a reference state, which means the program would abort if points are
! not found in the old mesh. This should not happen since the domain of the old and the new mesh is the same.

! Usage: posti_swapmesh swapmesh.ini SwapmeshExample_State_0000001.000000000.h5
