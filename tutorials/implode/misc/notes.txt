I've attached a t=2.5 shot of FV elements showing some FV present.  I
used Minmod with Ind=(-4,-3) with DG beginning at t = 0.01.

All 6 faces have "Wall Slip" (Boundary Type 9) conditions.  I believe
this is a solid wall but with free slip BC's.  I can run something else
if you'd like??


Here is the FV only full t=2.5 rotated setup and t=2.5 comparison plots.  The
rotation angle was 0.4 radians.  The plot to line pdf shows data along 2 rays
from origin to the midpoints of the 2 far box sides.  Both lines are symmetric
to the centerline of the box (perpendicular to the initial discontinuity.  If
the calculations are symmetric, these density plots should be a single line,
one atop the other.  They aren't.  These are at the end time.  I also showed
the density plot in the box at t=2.5 with the 2 rays to illustrate what I'd
done in the other plot. I have not yet compared these results to those without
rotation., but will do that soon.  Included are the hopr ini file and resulting
mesh.
