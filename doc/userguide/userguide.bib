  Abstract                 = {The finite difference methods of Godunov, Hyman, Lax and Wendroff (two-step), MacCormack, Rusanov, the upwind scheme, the hybrid scheme of Harten and Zwas, the antidiffusion method of Boris and Book, the artificial compression method of Harten, and Glimm's method, a random choice method, are discussed. The methods are used to integrate the one-dimensional Eulerian form of the equations of gas dynamics in Cartesian coordinates for an inviscid, nonheat-conducting fluid. The test problem was a typical shock tube problem. The results are compared and demonstrate that Glimm's method has several advantages.},
