# Workflow

This chapter describes the complete process of performing a simulation in **FLEXI**.
The process comprises the mesh generation using the high-order pre-processor **HOPR**, the actual simulation of the numerical problem, and the post-processing step using the **POSTI** toolchain. An overview of this workflow and the components of **FLEXI** is given in the flowchart below.

Basic modules and files used by **FLEXI**.
```
Note that both, **HOPR** and **FLEXI**, use the *HDF5* format to output mesh files and simulation states, respectively. HDF5 is a widely used data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of data types, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O, and for high volume, complex data. We refer to the [HDF5 website](https://www.hdfgroup.org) for further information on this file format in general.

(subsec:mesh_generation)=
## Mesh Generation using HOPR

**FLEXI** obtains its computational meshes from the high-order preprocessor **HOPR** (available under GPLv3 at [HOPR project](https://hopr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) in HDF5 format.
The design philosophy is that all tasks related to mesh organization, different input formats and the construction of high-order geometric mappings are separated from the *parallel* simulation code.
The *serial* standalone framework **HOPR** has been developed to generate high-order meshes from input data by external linear mesh generators, supporting different file formats. It also provides a built-in mesh generator for simple, structured meshes. **HOPR** can either be compiled from the source code or be used directly via the provided AppImage, both available on its [github page](https://github.com/hopr-framework/hopr/releases).

The basic command to run **HOPR** is
```bash
hopr parameter_hopr.ini
```
where the path to the **HOPR** executable has been omitted for simplicity.
The test cases provided in chapter {ref}`Tutorials` come with both a ready-to-use mesh file and a parameter file for **HOPR**, which can be used to generate or modify the meshes as needed.
Provided the mesh file has been set up, its location must be specified in the **FLEXI** parameter file.

```ini
MeshFile=path/to/mesh/file.h5
```

(subsec:solver_settings)=
## Build Configuration

Before setting up a simulation, the code must be compiled in the desired configuration. An overview of the most commonly used compiler options is given in section {ref}`sec:code_options`.
The default configuration solves the three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations using the pure DG operator (no FV shock-capturing) and does not compile any **POSTI** tools.

### Using CMake Presets

The build configurations used for the {ref}`Tutorials` are stored as *CMake presets* (human-readable format) in ``CMakePresets.json`` located in the FLEXI root directory. They can be applied by creating a build folder, reading the desired preset and compiling the code:
```bash
mkdir build
cmake -B build --preset <preset_name>
cmake --build build
```
```{caution}
CMake presets were introduced in CMake version 3.19. For earlier versions, **FLEXI** can only be configured manually.
```

### Manual Configuration
To configure the code manually, you can use the CMake GUI, which displays brief instructions and descriptions of the compiler options at the bottom of the window. Note that some compiler options are dependent on others, such that you should always *configure* by hitting the ``c`` key after changing the value of a compile option. In order to change values, use the arrow keys to select a compile option, and hit the enter key to edit its value; boolean options will toggle with the enter key. Once all desired options are set, *generate* the Makefiles by hitting the ``g`` key, exit by hitting the ``q`` key and compile using ``make``:
```bash
mkdir build
ccmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Parameter File

The computational setup of the considered test case, including solver settings, initial, and boundary conditions, material properties, data output, is specified via a parameter file. This file is typically named ``parameter_flexi_ini`` and contains a simple list of parameters, given in the form
```ini
! This is a comment, e.g. section heading
parameter_name = parameter_value
```
Note that the format is *case-insensitive* (Fortran-style) and that some parameters can also be listed multiple times (so-called ``CountOptions``).

To get a list and short description of all possible parameters, grouped thematically, run the **FLEXI** help
```bash
flexi --help
```
To confine the output to the parameters of a certain section or only one specific parameter, respectively, run
```bash
flexi --help SECTION
flexi --help PARAMETER
```

### Solver Settings
The definition of the numerical solver typically covers the following steps.

* **Set the polynomial degree.**
  
    Define the polynomial degree ``N`` of the solution. The order of convergence follows as $N+1$. Each grid cell contains $(N+1)^3$ collocation points to represent the solution.

* **Choose a dealiasing approach.**

    For under-resolved Navier-Stokes simulations, e.g., in an LES setting, dealiasing is important for numerical stability. Various choices are available and set using either *over-integration* or a *split-form* DG scheme. As the performance penalty of over-integration is substantial, the usage of the split formulation is recommended.
    * ``OverintegrationType=1`` is a filtering strategy, where the complete operator is first evaluated at ``N`` ($U_t^{N}$) and then filtered to a lower effective degree ``NUnder`` ($U_t^{Nunder}$). To use this variant, specify ``Nunder`` to a value smaller than ``N``.        
    * ``OverintegrationType=2`` is a filtering strategy, where the operator in reference space, e.g., $JU_t$, is first projected to the ``NUnder`` node set before converting it to physical space $U^{Nunder}_t=JU^{Nunder}_t/J^{Nunder}$. This implementation enforces conservation. To use this variant, specify ``Nunder`` to a value smaller than ``N``.
    * ``SplitDG`` uses a split formulation, requiring the compiler option ``FLEXI_SPLIT_DG`` to be turned on. The most commonly used options are the kinetic energy stable formulation by Pirozzoli {cite}`pirozzoli2010` (``PI``), the entropy conservative formulation by Chandrashekar {cite}`chandrashekar2013` (``CH``) and a flux differencing form equivalent to the standard DGSEM (``SD``).
        
* **Choose a Riemann solver.**
    
    The Riemann solver defines how the inter-element coupling is accomplished. The available variants are listed in section {ref}`sec:parameter_file`. Use the ``Riemann`` and the ``RiemannBC`` options to specify which Riemann solver is to be used at internal interfaces and at Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively. The default Riemann solver is `RoeEntropyFix`.

* **Choose a time discretization method.** 
    
    The time discretization method is set using the option ``TimeDiscMethod``. Various explicit Runge-Kutta variants are available and listed in section {ref}`sec:parameter_file`. By default, the low-storage fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme by {cite}`Carpenter1994` is employed.

(subsec:ic)=
### Initial Conditions

Both initial and boundary conditions are controlled via the so-called ``RefState`` and ``ExactFunction`` constructs.

The ``RefState`` specifies a state vector in primitive form $(\rho,u,v,w,p)^\intercal$. An arbitrary number of reference states can be defined:
```ini
RefState=(/1,1,0,0,0.71428571/)
RefState=(/1,0.3,0,0,0.71428571/)
```
In this example, the first state describes a parallel flow in $x$ direction at $Ma=1$, the second state at $Ma=0.3$, if an ideal gas with $\kappa = 1.4$ is used.

The code contains a number of predefined analytic solution fields (``ExactFunction``), which are invoked by specifying their respective number. For instance, the initialization of a simple constant freestream is achieved by setting
```ini
IniExactFunc=1
```
The associated state vector to be used is determined by
```ini
IniRefState=1
```
which, in the above example would imply that the first ``RefState`` is used for initialization. 

```{note}
The implemented exact functions are specific to the equation system and not documented comprehensively. They can be looked up in the source code, for example in ``src/equations/navierstokes/idealgas/exactfunc.f90``.
```

(subsec:bc)=
### Boundary Conditions

The names of the boundaries are contained in the mesh file and can be used in the **FLEXI** parameter file to override the boundary conditions set in the **HOPR** parameter file, if necessary.

**FLEXI** lists the boundaries and their respective boundary conditions during initialization, for example:
```bash
|                Name      Type     State     Alpha
|       BC_periodicz-         1         0         3
|       BC_periodicy-         1         0         2
|       BC_periodicx+         1         0        -1
|       BC_periodicy+         1         0        -2
|       BC_periodicx-         1         0         1
|       BC_periodicz+         1         0        -3
```

If we wished to apply a Dirichlet boundary condition with ``RefState=2`` at the two boundaries in $y$-direction, we would have to add the following lines to the parameter file
```ini
BoundaryName=BC_periodicy-
BoundaryType=(/2,2/)
BoundaryName=BC_periodicy+
BoundaryType=(/2,2/)
```

Note that the first entry in the brackets specifies ``BC_TYPE``, while the second specifies ``BC_STATE``, in this case the number of the ``RefState`` to be used. In general, ``BC_STATE`` identifies either a ``RefState``, an ``ExactFunction`` or remains empty, depending on the ``BC_TYPE``.

The currently implemented boundary conditions for the *Navier-Stokes equations* are listed in the table below. See {cite}`carlson2011inflow` for details on the listed inflow/outflow boundary conditions.

### Material Properties

At present, the only available equation of state in the *Navier-Stokes* solver of **FLEXI** is the ideal gas,
```{math}
p = \rho R T
```
with the gas constant $R$. The heat flux follows Fourier's law
```{math}
\vec{q} = -\lambda \nabla T \qquad \text{with} \quad \lambda = \frac{\kappa R \mu}{(\kappa-1) \mathrm{Pr}}
```
where $\lambda$ denotes the heat capacity ratio, $\mathrm{Pr}$ the Prandtl number and $\mu$ the dynamic viscosity.

These parameters are specified in the parameter file using ``R``, ``kappa``, ``Pr`` and ``mu0``, respectively.


### Data Output

The end time of the simulation is set using ``tEnd``. **FLEXI** features several analyze routines, which evaluate the current solution and are invoked every time interval ``Analyze_dt``.

Specifically, the following evaluations are possible:

* ``CalcErrorNorms=T``: Calculate the $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ error norms based on the specified ``ExactFunc`` as reference. This evaluation is used for, e.g., convergence tests.

* ``CalcBodyForces=T``: Calculate the pressure and viscous forces acting on every wall boundary condition (BC_TYPE=3,4 or 9) separately. The forces are written to *dat* files.

* ``CalcBulkState=T``: Calculate the bulk quantities, such as the bulk velocity for the channel flow.

* ``CalcWallVelocity=T``: Due to the discontinuous solution space and the weakly enforced boundaries, the no-slip condition is not exactly fulfilled. The deviation depends mainly on the resolution in the near-wall region. Thus, this evaluation can be used as a resolution measure at the wall.

The solution itself is dumped to hard drive every ``Analyze_dt`` as well, unless a multiple of this time interval is specified via ``nWriteData``. For example, ``nWriteData=10`` means that the solution output is performed every tenth analyze time step only.

(subsec:parallel_execution)=
## Running the Simulation

In general, the simulation is started by running
```bash
flexi parameter.ini [restart_file.h5]
```
The restart file is optional and allows resuming the simulation from any existing state file.

```{attention}
When restarting from an earlier time (or zero), all later state file possibly located in the present directory are deleted!
```

The simulation code is specifically designed for (massively) parallel execution using the MPI library. For parallel runs, the code must be compiled with `LIBS_USE_MPI=ON`. Parallel execution is then controlled using `mpirun`
```bash
mpirun -np <no. processors> flexi parameter.ini [restart_file.h5]
```
    
### Domain Decomposition

The grid elements are organized along a space-filling curve (SFC), which gives a unique one-dimensional element list. The SFC type is controlled by **HOPR**, with the Hilbert curve set as default. In a parallel run, the mesh is partitioned into as many subdomains as deployed processors simply by splitting the SFC evenly. Thus, domain decomposition is done *fully automatic* and is not limited by, e.g., an integer factor between the number of cores and elements. The only limitation is that the number of cores must not exceed the number of mesh elements.

### Choosing the Number of Cores
Parallel performance heavily depends on the number of processing cores. The performance index is defined as
```{math}
PID=\frac{WallTime \times \#Cores}{\#DOF \times \#TimeSteps \times \#RKstages}
```
and measures the wall time per degree of freedom and stage of the time integration scheme. During runtime, the average $PID$ is displayed in the output as

```bash
CALCULATION TIME PER STAGE/DOF: [ 5.59330E-07 sec ]
```
When compared to the single-core performance, it can be used as a parallel efficiency metric. The $PID$ mainly depends on the processor workload
```{math}
Load=\frac{\#DOF}{\#Cores}
```
and the polynomial degree $N$. Processor workloads for optimal performance lie in the range $Load=2000-5000$. A recent performance analysis on the HPE Appollo System *HAWK* using AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs is given in {cite}`Blind2023`

(subsec:testcase_env)=
## Test Case Environment

The test case environment can be used as to add test case-specific code for, e.g., custom source terms or diagnostics to be invoked during runtime. 

The test cases are contained in the folder ``src/testcase/`` and define standardized interfaces for initialization, source terms and analysis routines

```{list-table} Test case interfaces.
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab:testcase_interfaces
:align: center
:width: 100%
:widths: 20 40 40
* - Interface Name
  - Description
  - Example
* - InitTestcase
  - Read in test case related parameters from the **FLEXI** parameter file, initialize the corresponding data structures
  - Prescribed mass flow for `phill` testcase
* - FinalizeTestcase
  - Deallocate test case specific data structures
  -
* - ExactFuncTestcase
  - Define test case specific analytic expressions for initial or boundary conditions
  -

  - Compute test case specific source terms
  - pressure gradient in test case `channel`
* - TestCaseSource
  - Add test case specific source terms to equation system
  - apply pressure gradient in test case `channel`
* - AnalyzeTestCase
  - Perform test case specific diagnostics
  - evaluate dissipation rate of testcase `taylorgreenvortex`
```

The compiler option `FLEXI_TESTCASE` sets the current test case. Currently, supplied test cases are

* `default`
* `channel`: turbulent channel flow with steady pressure gradient source term
* `phill`: periodic hill flow with controlled pressure gradient source term \label{missing:phill_testcase}
* `riemann2d`: a two-dimensional Riemann problem
* `taylorgreenvortex`: automatic diagnostics for the Taylor-Green vortex flow

Note that the test case environment is currently only applicable to the Navier--Stokes equation system.


(subsec:post_processing)=
## Post Processing

### Overview of Toolchain

**FLEXI** comes with a post-processing tool-chain that is enabled through the compiler option `POSTI`. This **POSTI** tool-chain converts the **FLEXI** simulation results, stored in a custom data format in HDF5 files, into standardized data formats like *vtu*, which enable further post-processing and are readable by **ParaView**. Additionally, the tool-chain allows computing other quantities of interest derived from the stored variables.
Depending on the type of data output, there are different **POSTI** tools that can be used. The data types typically generated by simulations are as follows:

* ``StateFile``

  The transient flow state is stored in a so-called *StateFile*. Aside from the solution vector of the conserved variables `(Density, MomentumX, MomentumY, MomentumZ, EnergyStagnationDensity)`, it contains all relevant information to ensure a restart of the associated simulation time.

* ``TimeAverage``

  It is possible to carry out a statistical analysis (mean values and fluctuations) of specific variables during the simulation. A large number of variables can be analyzed statistically, including variables derived from the conserved variables. These statistics can be used, for example, to determine the local Reynolds stresses in the simulation. The associated averaging interval corresponds to the output interval. It is also possible to merge consecutive files and increase the effective averaging interval. 

* ``BaseFlow``

  This file is primarily required for consistent restarts. It stores a moving time average that is used for sponge zones, among others. 

* ``RecordPoints (RP) / probe data``

  In order to save data with a high temporal resolution without using too much memory, **FLEXI** offers the option of defining recordpoints/point probes. The data of the point samples are stored in the RP files for further processing. 

* ``CSV files``

  Depending on the selected settings, evaluations are calculated directly by **FLEXI** at runtime and are exported as CSV files. These files require no further processing and can be used directly for analysis. 

<!--The post-processing tools built into **FLEXI** are bundled in the **POSTI** tool suite. Here, the following features implemented, with most of them being covered in detail in the section {ref}`ToolsOverview`.-->
The most relevant **POSTI** tools are listed with a short description in the Table below.

```{list-table} Most relevant **POSTI** tools.

  - Converts the volume solution to files readable by e.g. Paraview.
```

### Basic Usage
In the following, the workflow on how to use the **POSTI** tools in general is briefly described at the example of `POSTI_VISU`.

Most **POSTI** tools have a help function that describes how to use the tool and the available parameters. This help can be invoked by running the tool with the flag `--help`, in this case
```bash
posti_visu --help
```

The `POSTI_VISU` tool reads a separate parameter file as optional first argument, while the files to be visualized are passed as the last argument. The latter can be a single file or several files, specified either as simple space-separated list like `Testcase_State_0.h5 Testcase_State_1.h5` or via standard wildcarding like `Testcase_State_*.h5`. The file must contain the entire volume solution, i.e., can be a StateFile or a TimeAverage file, for example.  

For serial execution, the `POSTI_VISU` tool is invoked by entering
```bash
posti_visu [parameter_postiVisu.ini [parameter_flexi.ini]] <statefiles>
```
The tool also runs in parallel by prepending `mpirun -np <no. processors>` to the above command, as usual, provided the compiler option `LIBS_USE_MPI` is enabled.
```bash
mpirun -np <no. processors> posti_visu [parameter_postiVisu.ini [parameter_flexi.ini]] <statefiles>
```

The most important runtime parameters to be set in `parameter_postiVisu.ini` are listed in table {numref}`tab:postivisu_parameters` in section {ref}`tools-visualization`.

The following lines can be used as an example for the `parameter_postiVisu.ini` file.

```ini
NVisu   = 10
varName = MomentumX
varName = VelocityX
varName = Density
varName = Pressure
varName = Temperature
```
